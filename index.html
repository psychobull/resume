        <p id="p1">My name is João Pedro Oliveira and I'm a second-year 
            Computer Science student at UENF (State University of 
            Norte Fluminense, Rio de Janeiro). I'm Brazilian and 
            started studying programming at the age of 14. Although 
            I entered university at 16, due to the pandemic, I was 
            already 17 when classes started. My family needed financial 
            assistance to survive, so I began receiving a grant of R$650 
            (approximately U$130). Starting my studies at such an early 
            age has given me excellent technical training and knowledge 
            that I value greatly.
        </p>
        <p>Teaching has been a significant aspect of my life since I 
            was 14 years old, and I'm confident that it will continue 
            to be so. Through higher education, I will be able to gain 
            experience and knowledge abroad that I can use to help my 
            country in its development.
        </p>
        <p>At UENF, I faced the challenge of assembling a team of 
            students and creating a simple website. Despite none of 
            us having prior experience, we were able to complete the 
            project in just four days.
        </p>
        <p>I am a hard-working individual who is passionate about 
            developing projects in the field of technology. My 
            ultimate goal is to use the knowledge I acquire to 
            contribute to my country's economic growth and progress 
            in technological advancements. My dedication is driven 
            by my desire to be a part of my country's future.
        </p>
